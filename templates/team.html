				<h1>Rich Asay</h1>
				<p>CPU, primary memory, input units, and output units. Long ago, the realm of computer processing hummed along in harmony. Then, everything changed when big data attacked. Only the render guru, master of all four elements of computer processing could handle big data. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. Several years passed and another team emerged, armed with computer science knowledge and numerous resources. Though their combined knowledge was great, they have a lot to learn before they can conquer their first dataset. But I believe this team can render data to save our world. </p>
